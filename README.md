# glowplug_windows

GlowPlug is a script to get your Windows workstation "warmed up" with your daily "programs.txt" (location of each directory, change username to your login for MS Teams) and your daily websites "links.txt" (newline per each site, opened in a new tab each with the default browser)

Prior to running the script, run PowerShell as admin "Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -force"
